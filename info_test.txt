NOSE2 customization options

1. Change search directory: nose2 -s DIR_ADD DIR_NAME
    DIR_NAME -> Directory in which we want to search
    DIR_ADD -> Adress of parent directory of DIR_NAME relative to the project source directory (Use "./" if directory is in project source directory)
    Usefull when wanting to test only one feature of your app at a time

2. Running specific test cases: nose2 -s DIR_ADD DIR_NAME.TEST_FILE.TEST_CLASS.TEST_NAME
    TEST_NAME -> Name of the Test method
    TEST_CLASS -> class in which the test method is defined
    TEST_FILE -> name of the test file in which the test case is defined
    DIR_NAME -> Directory in which the file exists
    DIR_ADD -> Address of the parent directory of DIR_NAME relative to the project source

3. Running tests in a single module: Can be also run by calling the function nose2.main()
